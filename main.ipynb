demonstrates accelerating growth in its user base\n\nsequoia capital india led the  million series a financing round in oneyearold airmeet redpoint ventures and existing investors accel india venture highway global founders capital gfc and gokul rajaram caviar lead at doordash also participated in the round\n\nthe new round values airmeet at about  million more than double of what it was valued in march when it raised  million according to a person familiar with the matter\n\nairmeet allows users and businesses to host interactive virtual events its platform intuitively replicates aspects of a physical event offering a backstage grouping people to a table allowing participants to network with each other and even enabling event organizers to work with sponsors airmeet currently in public beta is available through a freemium model where it charges businesses based on their usage\n\nin an interview with techcrunch lalit mangal cofounder of airmeet said the usage on the platform has grown  over the last quarter without any investment in advertisement he said\n\nin recent months airmeet has worked to expand the use cases of the platform in addition to hosting large conferences airmeet is now also being used for professional meetups at large film festivals he said recently it held university resource fairs and technical industry summits\n\n“covid has accelerated a permanent behavioral shift across many industries with digitization of largely traditional spaces leapfrogging by years the  billion global offline events space is up for grabs there is massive potential for players who drive the industry’s transition towards onlineevents” said abhishek mohan vp at sequoia capital india in a statement\n\nairmeet is built on top of webrtc a standard that most modern browsers follow this has enabled airmeet to be fully accessible through chrome and firefox all the sessions are also endtoend encrypted said mangal it does not have a mobile app mangal said people tend to use their laptop or desktop or their ipads for professional events users can consume a session through their mobile browser however\n\nthe startup which is in the same space as hopin and andreessen horowitzbacked run the world will use the fresh capital to add new features to airmeet and also scale globally said mangal\n\n“airmeet’s mission is to create a global platform to enable millions of community managers and event organizers across the world to engage with and expand their audience and with lalit and team’s focus execution and innovative thinking they are strongly placed to achieve their goal” said mohan\n\n\nRecommendation 2\n\nDate : 2020-09-07 00:00:00\nTitle : HumanForest gets $2.3M from Cabify founders and others to grow a ‘free’ e-bike sharing service – TechCrunch\nLink : http://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/humanforest-gets-2-3m-from-cabify-founders-and-others-to-grow-a-free-e-bike-sharing-service/\nSimilarity score: 0.8410198873094101\nDetails : humanforest a dockless shared and adsupported ebike service which began trialling a service in london this june has taken in its first tranche of external funding the £ million m investment comes from backers in the mobility space including juan de antonio and vicente pascual founders of ridesharing app cabify\n\nas part of the investment cabify’s pascual has joined the humanforest board along with stefan tilks exvolvo president and ceo of nevs ab a swedish electric car manufacturer humanforest’s cofounder and ceo agustin guilisasti is a former cabify country manager\n\nhumanforest’s ebike sharing service is limited to london for now and journeys must also be terminated within just two boroughs in north london islington and camden though it’s aiming to expand parking to other boroughs within the capital as it scales\n\nit says the new funding will be used to grow its bike fleet to  at the end of this month — and is aiming to have  ebikes in london within a year\n\nebike sharing has exploded in recent years with ridehailing giants like uber jumping into the category as mobility players seek to diversify and while uber soon offloaded its jump bike assets in europe to micromobility player lime after making a major investment in the escooter rival service gaps in key commuter cities are quick to attract new rivals — such as bolt now pushing an ebike offering in paris\n\ndespite all this activity humanforest reckons there’s still room to innovate on the ebike sharing model\n\nits flagship pledge is it’s london’s only “free” shared ebike service — as it offers users  free minutes of ride time per day the free ride minutes are supported by ads shown via the humanforest app pricing thereafter is £ per minute though humanforest says users may be able to gain further free ride minutes via promotions and competitions\n\npartner companies for humanforest’s digital marketing platform which includes the likes of whole foods and rude health at this starter stage are thus subsidising free trips in exchange for pushing their marketing message within a social impact product\n\nanother strand to its model is a subscription ebike service for corporates — with humanforest spying an opportunity to offer londoners an alternative and green means of commuting to work in the postcovid era that avoids the need to pack onto public transport\n\nhumanforest’s ebikes are powered by a rechargeable battery pack that’s good for km on a single charge it takes care of charging and swapping the packs — and touts that both batteries and its service vehicles are changed with certified renewable energy sources\n\ncommenting on the funding in a statement pascual said “i worked with the team at humanforest for ten years at cabify and i believe that this is another disruptor it is three disruptors in one it provides free mobility for users through its partnership model protects the planet and appeals to partner companies who seek to demonstrate their social impact we are already seeing the success of the model and i am excited to be involved in its future growth”\n\nwhile shared mobility services have also been hit by concerns related to risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus bikes are at least used outdoors where there are no worries about lack of ventilation\n\non sanitation an faq on humanforest’s website notes that disinfectant spray is provided with each ebike it recommends users wipe down the handlebars and brake handles before and after riding as well as suggesting the wearing of gloves\n\n\nRecommendation 3\n\nDate : 2020-09-02 00:00:00\nTitle :

did you gravitate toward kids\n\nwhen kids are there they steal the show i do love me some old people though the beginning and the end of the life spectrum but i think when you look at kids you definitely see what we’re investing in what those kids are eating how they’re living it is a real indicator of the future you can see red or blue states or left or right but i don’t think anyone doesn’t come together in agreement that we all want to take care of our kids\n\nfood insecurity is a topic of national conversation what is the subtext that you know to be true when you see those

food lines there’s a moratorium on the shame and your virtue being tied to feeding yourself\n\nwhen i see those headlines i want to keep it in the forefront of our collective consciousness that — just

since india enforced a lockdown across the country in late march shutting schools and other public places bangaloreheadquartered startup byju’s has emerged as one of the quintessential platforms for schoolgoing students in the world’s second largest internet market\n\nit took the startup about four and a half years to amass  million students since the lockdown its user base has ballooned to  million its cofounder and chief executive byju raveendran said at the disrupt  conference tuesday\n\nstudents say they were attracted to byju’s platform because of the way it taught them subjects byju who is a teacher himself found intuitive ways like using reallife objects such as a pizza to teach complex math problems\n\nhis startup is valued at nearly  billion as of last week which makes it india’s second most valuable startup and has presence across several international markets late last year byju’s announced it has also turned profitable it’s not everyday that we see an indian startup with any of these three characteristics — let alone all three in one\n\nin a wideranging interview at disrupt  raveendran shared the journey of byju’s which started as an offline platform that taught students at classrooms auditoriums and stadiums the startup’s plans for further expansion in international markets his views on merger and acquisition opportunities and how the coronavirus pandemic has affected his business and the education landscape at large in india among a number of other things\n\n“unfortunately it took a pandemic for most stakeholders to try out digital learning parents are now accepting the online segment more than before this sector is clearly at an inflexion point” said raveendran\n\nto make online learning more accessible to students byju’s made all of its offerings free during the pandemic but the platform’s paying subscribers now at more than  million remains on a steady path of growth he said\n\nthe startup expects to generate more than  billion in revenue this year from india itself and take home profits between  million to  million he said\n\n“i would still call it a relative success what we consider as the target audience we have less than  of penetration in that segment” he said “more than onethird of schoolgoing students don’t have a smartphone there’s still a lot of catch up to do”\n\nanother phenomenon that the pandemic has kickstarted in india is some consolidation in the edtech startup space byju’s itself acquired whitehat jr an monthold startup that teaches coding skills to students for  million\n\ntechcrunch has reported that the startup is engaging with several more startups including indian firm doubtnut which through its app allows students to take a picture of a math problem and delivers a stepbystep solution\n\nhere’s what raveendran had to say about that “the longterm potential of the sector is at an alltime high … we are looking for companies that can add strong product components to either our existing user base or potential new customers in new markets or companies that can give us some kind of distribution so that we get a head start to launch in a new market — especially english speaking markets”\n\n“you will hear of a few more acquisitions from us we are exploring some of them very seriously” he added the future acquisitions will again be allcash deals raveendran said as he “values equity more than others”\n\non ipo fundraise and international expansion\n\nbyju’s isn’t looking to go public for at least two years the chief executive said “we have strong business fundamentals we have been able to find the right balance between highgrowth and sustainable growth and created a very profitable model in such a short period of time but we have not seriously thought about the public listing” he added\n\nand it appears that investors in byju’s are also not in a hurry “we don’t need to do public listing to give exit to some of the early investors because the business itself will generate enough cash a good number of them have already taken the money they invested out in the last few rounds” he said\n\nbyju’s has raised more than  million this year we asked raveendran why is the startup raising capital “we have been very capitalefficient in terms of how we have used the primary capital we have raised in the first five years we have utilized less than  million of the primary capital — which shows how we have efficiently scaled the model” he said\n\n“most of the recent fundraising is to finance inorganic growth like fullcash acquisitions we are utilizing it to add some strong business models we never raised money because we needed it it was always to add the right partner in recent times we have added longterm patient investors” he said byju’s is likely not done with its fundraising spree yet as the startup is currently engaging with at least two more investment firms\n\nfor expansion in international markets raveendran said it plans to launch a digital learning app aimed at kids in several englishspeaking markets he said whitehat jr will introduce math subjects to its offering to serve customers in several markets including australia new zealand\n\nwe also talked about what he thinks of other giant startups in india that are not profitable today the kind of message that sends to international investors and whether there is room for any new player in the education market in india and much more you can watch the full interview below\n\n\nRecommendation 5\n\nDate : 2020-08-31 00:00:00\nTitle : Chan Zuckerberg Initiative backs

opportunity to offer londoners an alternative and green means of commuting to work in the postcovid era that avoids the need to pack onto public transport\n\nhumanforest’s ebikes are powered by a

three disruptors in one it provides free mobility for users through its partnership model protects the planet and appeals to partner companies who seek to demonstrate their social impact we are already seeing the success of the model and i am excited to be involved in its future growth”\n\nwhile shared mobility services have also been hit by concerns related to risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus bikes are at least used outdoors where there are no worries about lack of ventilation\n\non sanitation an faq on humanforest’s website notes that disinfectant spray is provided with each

on children in this project why did you gravitate toward kids\n\nwhen kids are there they steal the show i do love me some old people though the beginning and the end of the life spectrum but i think when you look at kids you definitely see what we’re investing in what those kids are eating how they’re living it is a real indicator of the future you can see red or blue states or left or right but i don’t think anyone doesn’t come together in agreement that we all want to take care of our kids\n\nfood insecurity is a topic of national conversation what is the subtext that you know to be true when you see those headlines\n\nthere’s this idea that people have to deserve being fed to earn their right to eat in covid that has been laid aside and you have people from across the political spectrum showing up at food lines there’s a moratorium on the shame and your virtue being tied to feeding yourself\n\nwhen i see those headlines i want to keep it in the forefront of our collective consciousness that — just like the great depression — the people who are going to be the hardest hit by struggle have always been struggling there has been a landscape of insecurity and economic inequity that has only been widening over the past decade\n\n\nRecommendation 4\n\nDate : 2020-09-15 00:00:00+00:00\nTitle : Indian decacorn Byju’s CEO talks about future acquisitions, coronavirus and

quintessential platforms for schoolgoing students in the world’s second largest internet market\n\nit took the startup about four and a half years to amass  million students since the lockdown its user base has ballooned to  million its cofounder and chief executive byju raveendran said at the disrupt  conference tuesday\n\nstudents say they were attracted to byju’s platform because of the way it taught them subjects byju who is a teacher himself found intuitive ways like using reallife objects such as a pizza to teach complex math problems\n\nhis startup is valued at nearly  billion as of last week which makes it india’s second most valuable startup and has presence across several international markets late last year byju’s announced it has also turned profitable it’s not everyday that we see an indian startup with any of these three characteristics — let alone all three in one\n\nin a wideranging interview at disrupt  raveendran shared the journey of byju’s which started as an offline platform that taught students at classrooms auditoriums and stadiums the startup’s plans for further expansion in international markets his views on merger and acquisition opportunities and how the coronavirus pandemic has affected his business and the education landscape at large in india among a number of other things\n\n“unfortunately it took a pandemic for most stakeholders to try out digital learning parents are now accepting the online segment more than before this sector is clearly at an inflexion point” said raveendran\n\nto make online learning more accessible to students byju’s made all of its offerings free during the pandemic but the platform’s paying subscribers now at more than  million remains on a steady path of growth he said\n\nthe startup expects to generate more than  billion in revenue this year from india itself and take home profits between  million to  million he said\n\n“i would still call it a relative success what we consider as the target audience we have less than  of penetration in that segment” he said “more than onethird of schoolgoing students don’t have a smartphone there’s still a lot of catch up to do”\n\nanother phenomenon that the pandemic has kickstarted in india is some consolidation in the edtech startup space byju’s itself acquired whitehat jr an monthold startup that teaches coding skills to students for  million\n\ntechcrunch has reported that the startup is engaging with several more startups including indian firm doubtnut which through its app allows students to take a picture of a math problem and delivers a stepbystep solution\n\nhere’s what raveendran had to say about that “the longterm potential of the sector is at an alltime high … we are looking for companies that can add strong product components to either our existing user base or potential new customers in new markets or companies that can give us some kind of distribution so that we get a head start to launch in a new market — especially english speaking markets”\n\n“you will hear of a few more acquisitions from us we are exploring some of them very seriously” he added the future acquisitions will again be allcash deals raveendran said as he “values equity more than others”\n\non ipo fundraise and international expansion\n\nbyju’s isn’t looking to go public for at least two years the chief executive said “we have strong business fundamentals we have been able to find the right balance between highgrowth and sustainable growth and created a very profitable model in such a short period of time but we have not seriously thought about the public listing” he added\n\nand it appears that investors in byju’s are also not in a hurry “we don’t need to do public listing to give exit to some of the early investors because the business itself will generate enough cash a good number of them have already taken the money they invested out in the last few rounds” he said\n\nbyju’s has raised more than  million this year we asked raveendran why is the startup raising capital “we have been very capitalefficient in terms of how we have used the primary capital we have raised in the first five years we have utilized less than  million of the primary capital — which shows how we have efficiently scaled the model” he said\n\n“most of the recent fundraising is to finance inorganic growth like fullcash acquisitions we are utilizing it to add some strong business models we never raised money because we needed it it was always to add the right partner in recent times we have added longterm patient investors” he said byju’s is likely not done with its fundraising spree yet as the startup is currently engaging with at least two more investment firms\n\nfor expansion in international markets raveendran said it plans to launch a digital learning app aimed at kids in several englishspeaking markets he said whitehat jr will introduce math subjects to its offering to serve customers in several markets including australia new zealand\n\nwe also talked about what he thinks of other giant startups in india that are not profitable today the kind of message that sends to international investors and whether there is room for any new player in the education market in india and much more you can watch the full interview below\n\n\nRecommendation 5\n\nDate : 2020-08-31 00:00:00+00:00\nTitle : Chan Zuckerberg
